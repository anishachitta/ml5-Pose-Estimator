# ml5 Pose Estimator with p5.js

This project is a real-time pose estimation application built using [ml5.js](https://ml5js.org/), [PoseNet](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/posenet), and [p5.js](https://p5js.org/). It captures video from a webcam, processes the frames using the PoseNet model, and visualizes detected poses with an interactive canvas.

## Features
- **Real-time Pose Estimation**: Uses the PoseNet model from ml5.js to estimate human poses from live webcam feed.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Draws keypoints and skeletal connections on a p5.js canvas, showing real-time movements.
- **Easy Integration**: Combines the simplicity of p5.js for creative coding with the power of ml5.js for machine learning.

## Technologies Used
- **ml5.js**: A friendly high-level interface to TensorFlow.js for machine learning in the browser.
- **PoseNet**: A vision model that estimates the poses of multiple people in an image or video.
- **p5.js**: A JavaScript library that makes coding accessible for artists, designers, educators, and beginners.
